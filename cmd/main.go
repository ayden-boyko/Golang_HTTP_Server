// Error handling: In your initDB function, you're using log.Fatalf to handle errors.
// 					While this is acceptable for development, you might want to consider using a more robust error handling mechanism,
// 					such as returning errors and letting the caller decide how to handle them.

// Imports: You're using some external libraries (e.g., github.com/ayden-boyko/Convert_Service_Go/pkg), which is fine.
// 		However, you might want to consider vendoring these dependencies to ensure your project is self-contained.
